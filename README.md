**# IMCHANGER**

IMCHANGER is a bash script tool designed to enhance network anonymity by periodically changing the MAC and IP addresses of a specified network interface. It ensures that the necessary tools are installed, displays a large banner, changes the MAC and IP addresses, and can revert to the original settings. The tool runs in a loop, changing the network settings every 30 seconds for 30 minutes.

**# Features**

- Checks and installs necessary tools (`macchanger`, `ifconfig`, `dhclient`, `figlet`).
- Displays a large ASCII art banner.
- Changes the MAC address to a random one from a known vendor.
- Changes the IP address by releasing and renewing it.
- Reverts to the original MAC and IP address.
- Runs in a loop for 30 minutes, changing settings every 30 seconds.
